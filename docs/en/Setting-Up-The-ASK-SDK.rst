Setting up the ASK SDK for Java
===============================

This guide describes how to use the ASK SDK v2 for Java in your project.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  An `Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ project.
-  A suitable Java development environment. The ASK SDK v2 for Java
   requires a Java 8 compatible runtime environment.

Adding the SDK to your project
------------------------------

To use the ASK SDK v2 for Java in your project, declare it as a
dependency on your project’s ``pom.xml`` file. You can choose to depend
on the standard SDK distribution or individually select the components
on which to depend. The standard SDK distribution is the easiest way to
quickly get up and running with the SDK. It includes the core SDK and
the following additional modules that provide commonly used
functionality:

-  AWS Lambda support module, which allows skills to be run as part of
   an AWS Lambda function
-  Servlet support module, which allows skills to be run as a servlet on
   a web server
-  Amazon DynamoDB persistence adapter, which enables storing skill
   attributes to DynamoDB
-  Apache HTTPClient API client plugin, which leverages the Apache
   HttpClient to make API calls to Alexa services

Including all standard SDK components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From your Maven project’s ``pom.xml`` add the following dependency to
pull in the standard ASK SDK v2 for Java distribution:

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

Including individual SDK components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select one or more of the following modules to include in your project
by adding the corresponding entry to your ``pom.xml`` file. To minimize
dependency closure, add only the modules that you need.

**Core SDK (required)**

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk-core</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

**AWS Lambda support module**

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk-lambda-support</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

**Servlet support module**

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk-servlet-support</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

**Amazon DynamoDB persistence adapter**

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk-dynamodb-persistence-adapter</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

**Apache HTTPClient API client plugin**

::

   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.amazon.alexa</groupId>
     <artifactId>ask-sdk-apache-client</artifactId>
     <version>2.17.0</version>
   </dependency>

Next Steps
----------

Now that you’ve added the SDK to your project, you’re ready to begin
developing a skill. Proceed to the next section, `Developing Your First
Skill <Developing-Your-First-Skill.html>`__, for instructions on getting
started with a basic skill.
